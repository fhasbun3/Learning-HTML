<p>Tags are used to identify the content of a page. For example this text is
considered a parragraph. Also you can add emphasis to the parragraph by doing
the following: <em>I added some EMPHASIS</em> and you can also set the text
bold by doing the following: <strong>I'm setting this text bold</strong></p>
