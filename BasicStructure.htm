/*Document Type Declaration:
-goes at the beginning of your code
-tells the browser/user which version of HTML you are using so that it knows
 which version of the syntax it is parsing.
-usually we use <!DOCTYPE HTML>*/

/*Document Head:
-It's where you place information about the document
-How the document should be renderd
-META TAGS: one piece in a large algorithmic puzzle that major search engines
 look at when deciding which results are relevant to show users who have typed
 in a search query
-META TAGS DON'T NEED CLOSING TAGS
-ALWAYS add a META TAG to your head as the first thing after the head tag
-finally add the title that you want your page to have by adding the title tag
*/

/*Document Body:
-where all the visible content of your page goes (i.e. titles, parragraphs etc.)
*/

/*Content Models:
-define the typ eof content expected inside an element, and control syntax rules
such as element nesting*/
