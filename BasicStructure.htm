/*Document Type Declaration:
-goes at the beginning of your code
-tells the browser/user which version of HTML you are using so that it knows
 which version of the syntax it is parsing.
-usually we use <!DOCTYPE HTML>*/

/*Document Head:
-It's where you place information about the document
-How the document should be renderd
-META TAGS: one piece in a large algorithmic puzzle that major search engines
 look at when deciding which results are relevant to show users who have typed
 in a search query
-META TAGS DON'T NEED CLOSING TAGS
-ALWAYS add a META TAG to your head as the first thing after the head tag
-finally add the title that you want your page to have by adding the title tag
*/

/*Document Body:
-where all the visible content of your page goes (i.e. titles, parragraphs etc.)
*/

/*Content Models:
-define the type of content expected inside an element, and control syntax rules
such as element nesting
-Two main Content Models (HTML 4):
    -Block Level:
    take up their own line within the flow of a document (i.e. parragraphs)
    -In Line:
    appear within a line (i.e. when you put bold letters)

-Now in HTML 5, there are seven main models
    -Flow: elements used in the body of documents and applicatinos

    -Metadata: content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of
               the content, setus up the relationsip between documents and
               conveys other "out of band" info

    -Embedded: content that imports another resource into the document

    -Interactive: content intended for user interaction

    -Heading: defines the header of a section

    -Phrasing: the text of a document

    -Sectioning: content that defines the scope of headings and footers
